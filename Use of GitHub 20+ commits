I've completed the project.
It was a challenge to make a game work. 
The trickiest part in both instruction coding and the unity was telling them what to do and it was exactly what I wanted. 
To be honest, I don't have much experience about how to tell them what to do but I know more or less about coding and what it does. 
I somehow began to understand how the calculator game works out, and to me it was a good experience.
